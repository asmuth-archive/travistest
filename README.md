<h3>clip â€“ The command line illustration processor</h3>

clip (the _command line illustration processor_) is an open-source command line
program and software library for creating charts and other programmatic
illustrations. In essence, clip consists of a library of drawing commands. This
command library includes high-level building blocks for creating common chart
types as well as lower-level drawing primitives such as markers, arrows and lines.

Introduction
------------

Being a highly visual tool, clip is best explained by example. So here is how to
draw a simple line chart using clip):

    $ clip --export example_chart.svg example_chart.clp

The command reads an input file (`example_chart.clp`) and produces an output SVG
file from it. This is the input file:

    (figure/plot
        limit-x (0 7200)
        limit-y (0 100)
        lines (
            data-x (csv "measurement.csv" time)
            data-y (csv "measurement.csv" value)
            stroke-width 0.8pt)
        grid (
            stroke-color #333
            stroke-style dashed))

The resulting SVG file looks like this:

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://clip-lang.org/examples/charts-scientific/vectorfield">
    <img src="/doc/demo.svg" width="80%" alt="Demo Chart" />
  </a>
</div>

Note that this example is only intended to give you an idea of what the syntax
looks like; for an in-depth description of all parameters, please refer to
[the documentation](https://clip-lang.org). More examples can be found on

Installation
------------

#### Using homebrew (macOS)

To install clip using homebrew, run the following command:

    $ brew install clip

#### Compile from source

To build clip, you need an up-to-date C++ compiler, cmake, fmtlib, libharfbuzz,
libfreetype and cairo. Then run:

    $ cmake .
    $ make

To install the `clip` binary into your system, run `make install`:

    $ make install

To run the test suite, run `make test`:

    $ make test


For detailed installation instructions, have a look at the [Installation](https://clip-lang.org/documentation/installation/)
page.


FAQ
---

#### I'm getting build errors when compiling the code

clip is written in C++17 and requires a reasonably modern C++ compiler and standard
library. In most cases where the code doesn't build it's due to some problem with
the local build environment. Still, we always appreciate bug reports via Github
Issues so that we can improve our build system.

#### The test suite fails on my machine because text placement is slightly offset

The test suite requires that you have the original Microsoft Arial TTF files
installed on your machine. To verify that this is the case, run `fc-match
'Arial,Helvetica,Helvetica Neue:style=Regular,Roman'` and check that it returns
the correct 'arial.ttf' file.

#### What happened to the project name?

The project was started in 2011 and was initially called "FnordMetric". The
first version from 8 years ago also included facilities for storing and
transforming data in addition to the charting code. Over time, the data
processing parts were removed, leaving only the plotting code. However, as a
consequence, most of the search queries for the project name would return
outdated information, resulting in a generally confusing and stale-feeling
situation. The best solution seemed to be to rename the project and so it was
renamed to "clip".

    and [harfbuzz](https://harfbuzz.org) stack.

  - The structure of the plot elements is based on ideas from [The Grammar of
    Graphics](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447) and the
